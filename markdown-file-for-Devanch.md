# MeriFile on WhatsApp — A Simple, Smart File Assistant

MeriFile is your personal file assistant on WhatsApp. Just send a message or share a file, and it takes care of organizing, remembering, and retrieving your documents for you — in plain, friendly chat.

## What you can do with MeriFile

### Save any file in a chat
Send a document, image, PDF, or other attachment on WhatsApp. MeriFile stores it for you and keeps it ready for future use.

### Name your files the easy way
If you want a specific name, just include it in your message (for example, “name it Salary Slip” or simply “Salary Slip” along with the file). MeriFile will use that name while saving.

### Automatic summaries and titles
MeriFile automatically creates a helpful title and description, and it can extract key dates from your document so you don’t have to.

### Searchable list of everything you’ve saved
Ask MeriFile to list your files, and you’ll get a clean, readable list with titles, descriptions, and IDs so you can find what you need quickly.

### Get any file back instantly
When you want a file, just ask for it. MeriFile finds the best match and sends the file back to you directly in the chat.

### Voice notes are understood too
Prefer speaking? Send a voice note. MeriFile transcribes it for you. If your voice note is in Hindi, it automatically translates it to English so your request is crystal clear.

### No duplicates, no clutter
If you accidentally send the same file again, MeriFile recognizes it and avoids saving duplicates.

### Works smoothly in the WhatsApp sandbox
If you’re using the WhatsApp sandbox, MeriFile guides you through joining and even sends a friendly reminder before your access expires.
